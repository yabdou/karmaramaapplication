In order to show why I should be a Karma Kadet I've made this online mixtape of songs that (hopefully) demonstrate the reasons!</h2> 

            		<p>I have chosen only four of the songs to explain, but the full mixtape is at the bottom of the page. But for now, click on the numbers to see what I've written. A CAVEAT: I'm sorry for the cheese. And the puns. And the desperate sounding title.</p>

                    <p class="maintext">"Tell Me" by the Wonder Girls is a K-pop classic. The vast majority of the song is not in English but it still reflects my communication skills and affinity and fondness for collaborating and working in teams! I like getting things done, and as much as some like to think, you can't do everything alone.</p>

                    <p class="maintext">I love technology, and I admire the impact it has already had in the world and the creative potential it so clearly still holds. I love the fact that Karmarama is an integrated, tech-forward agency and that's a big reason as to why I want to work here. I've basically been on computers since I was about five, and I don't see that stopping soon. I love St. Vincent and how innovative she is. She designed a new guitar for the female body. All I've done is design this webpage, but I guess you have to start somewhere. I'm making my Year Three English teacher angry somewhere by beginning all me sentences with 'I'.</p>

                    <p class="maintext">Back in the nineteenth century, Lisztomania was a valid form of hysteria directed towards the composer Franz Liszt by his fans during his concerts. I am a massive music fan (hence why I possess this fact, hence why I made a mixtape) but thankfully not quite enough to experience such a reaction to my faves. Anyway, while my chosen example is a bit arcane, my point is that I want to fuse my interest and (almost embarrasing) knowledge of popular culture with an agency (this agency) that seems to love it as much as I do. </p>
                    <p> Fun Fact: I once won tickets to see Phoenix at the iTunes festival. A couple of nights before I had a dream that they would postpone. The day before the concert it was announced that the show was cancelled. I started to cry. I was 17. (bit hysterical) </p>
